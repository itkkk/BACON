<b>B</b>in<b>A</b>ry <b>C</b>lassificati<b>O</b>n <b>N</b>etwork is a simple project inspired to the popular L-layer network devoloped as exercize during the famous Andrew Ng's course <i>"Neural Networks and Deep Learning"</i>. <br>
As the name says, the nework could be used to perform binary classification. It exploits the relu activation function for the first L-1 layers, while the sigmoid function is used in the latest neuron.
<br><br>
I tried to make it more object oriented, incapsulating all the principal methods in a class called "model".
<br>
I tested some topology on netowrk on two dataset, which you can find the datasets folder: catvnocat and Pima Indians Diabetes.
I got 80% test accuracy for the first dataset and 71% test accuracy for the second dataset.
